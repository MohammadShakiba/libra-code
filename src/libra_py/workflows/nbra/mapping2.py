       to many-electron ones (e.g. Slater Determinat basis). Revised version to simplify the user's experience

def sd2indx(sd):
    """

    This function maps integers from the user that appear in the SD definition to internal indices

    Args:
        sd ( list of ints ): ids of the occupied orbitals in a given SD configuration. Indexing starts with 1, not 0!

            Positive numbers correspond to an alpha electron occupying the orbital

            Negative numbers correspond to a beta electron occupying the orbital

    Returns:
        3 list of ints: the indices of the orbitals occupied in this SD in internal notation, the indexing starts from 0
             The first list - is for all orbitals, second - for alpha, and third - for beta

    Example:

        Assume our active space consists of 2 orbitals: |1>,|2>

        One can then define 2-electron configurations like:  | 1a, 1b | or |1a, 2b|, etc.

        Here a and b refer to spin of electron occupying these orbitals

        On the user side, these configurations would be encoded as [1, -1] and [1, -2], respectively

        This function will map these numbers into [1, -1] -> [0, 0] and [1, -2] -> [0, 1]
