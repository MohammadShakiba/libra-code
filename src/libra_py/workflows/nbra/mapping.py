def sd2indx(inp, nbasis=0, do_sort=False, user_notation=0):
    """

    This function maps a list of integers defining the
    occupied spin-orbitals in a SD onto the global indices of the orbitals
    that are being occupied.

    Args:
        inp ( list of ints ): indices of the occupied spin-orbitals.
            Indexing starts with 1, not 0!

            Positive number ```n``` correspond to an alpha electron occupying the
            orbital (whether it is an alpha-spatial or beta-spatial component) ```n```

            Negative number ```-n``` correspond to a beta electron occupying the
            orbital (whether it is an alpha-spatial or beta-spatial component) ```n```

        nbasis ( int ): the total number of orbitals orbitals (both alpha- and beta-
            spatial components ) in the selected active space [currently not really used!]

        do_sort ( Boolean ): the flag to tell whether the indices should be sorted in
            a particular order:
                - True - for new scheme (needed for the SAC) [default]
                - use with False for Pyxaid mapping!

        user_notation (int):
            - 0 : short-hand - in this case, the mapping goes into [0, N) range [default - because it has been used for a while]
            - 1 : extended - in this case, the mapping goes into [0, 2*N) range


    Returns:
        list of ints: the indices of the orbitals occupied in this SD (different convention)

    Example:

        Assume out active space consists of 4 orbitals:  |1^a>, |1^b>, |2^a>, |2^b>.
        Here, the superscript indicates the spin-component of the given orbital.

        In the step2 they are grouped as |1^a>, |2^a>, |1^b>, |2^b>

        And indexed (overall) as:           1     2      3      4  (as used in the input)
                                            0     1      2      3  (as used in the output)
        Note: this indexing convention assumes starting from 1, not from 0!

        So the ```nbasis``` should be = 4

        Input SD = [1, -3] means that the orbital |1^a> is occupied by an alpha electron |a>
        and the orbital |1^b> is occupied by a beta electron |b>, so the SD is:

        SD = 1/sqrt(2) * | |1^a>|a>   |1^b>|b> |

        This function will return the global indices of the occupied orbitals in the
        set of active orbitals. That is the conversion will be:
        [1, -3] -> [0, 2]
        Note that the output indices start from 0
